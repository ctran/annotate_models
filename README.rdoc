Add a comment summarizing the current schema to the top or bottom of each of
your...

- ActiveRecord models
- Fixture files
- Tests and Specs
- Object Daddy exemplars
- Machinist blueprints
- Fabrication fabricators
- Thoughtbot's factory_girl factories, i.e. the (spec|test)/factories/<model>_factory.rb files
- routes.rb file (for Rails projects)

The schema comment looks like this:

   # == Schema Info
   #
   # Table name: line_items
   #
   #  id                  :integer(11)    not null, primary key
   #  quantity            :integer(11)    not null
   #  product_id          :integer(11)    not null
   #  unit_price          :float
   #  order_id            :integer(11)
   #

    class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :product
     . . .

It also annotates geometrical columns, geom type and srid, when using
+SpatialAdapter+, +PostgisAdapter+ or +PostGISAdapter+:

   # == Schema Info
   #
   # Table name: trips
   #
   #  local           :geometry        point, 4326
   #  path            :geometry        line_string, 4326

Also, if you pass the -r option, it'll annotate routes.rb with the output of
<code>rake routes</code>.


== Install

Into Gemfile from rubygems.org:

    gem 'annotate'

Into Gemfile from Github:

    gem 'annotate', github: 'ctran/annotate_models'

Into environment gems from rubygems.org:

    gem install annotate

Into environment gems from Github checkout:

    git clone git://github.com/ctran/annotate_models.git annotate_models
    cd annotate_models
    rake build
    gem install pkg/annotate-*.gem


== Usage

(If you used the Gemfile install, prefix the below commands with <code>bundle exec</code>.)

=== Usage in Rails

To annotate all your models, tests, fixtures, and factories:

    cd /path/to/app
    annotate

To annotate just your models, tests, and factories:

    annotate --exclude fixtures

To annotate just your models:

    annotate --exclude tests,fixtures,factories,serializers

To annotate routes.rb:

    annotate --routes

To remove model/test/fixture/factory/serializer annotations:

    annotate --delete

To remove routes.rb annotations:

    annotate --routes --delete

To automatically annotate every time you run <code>db:migrate</code>, either run <code>rails g annotate:install</code> or add +Annotate.load_tasks+ to your `Rakefile`. See the {configuration in Rails}[link:README.rdoc#configuration-in-rails] section for more info.

=== Usage Outside of Rails

Everything above applies, except that +--routes+ is not meaningful, and you will
probably need to explicitly set one or more +--require+ option(s), and/or one
or more +--model-dir+ options to inform annotate about the structure of your
project and help it bootstrap and load the relevant code.


== Configuration

If you want to always skip annotations on a particular model, add this string
anywhere in the file:

    # -*- SkipSchemaAnnotations

=== Configuration in Rails

To generate a configuration file (in the form of a +.rake+ file), to set
default options:

    rails g annotate:install

Edit this file to control things like output format, where annotations are
added (top or bottom of file), and in which artifacts.

The generated rakefile +lib/tasks/auto_annotate_models.rake+ also contains
`Annotate.load_tasks`. This adds a few rake tasks which duplicate command-line
functionality:

    rake annotate_models                          # Add schema information (as comments) to model and fixture files
    rake annotate_routes                          # Adds the route map to routes.rb
    rake remove_annotation                        # Remove schema information from model and fixture files

By default, once you've generated a configuration file, annotate will be
executed whenever you run <code>rake db:migrate</code> (but only in development mode).
If you want to disable this behavior permanently, edit the +.rake+ file and
change:

    'skip_on_db_migrate'   => 'false',

To:

    'skip_on_db_migrate'   => 'true',

If you want to run <code>rake db:migrate</code> as a one-off without running annotate,
you can do so with a simple environment variable, instead of editing the
+.rake+ file:

    skip_on_db_migrate=1 rake db:migrate

        -I, --ignore-columns REGEX       don't annotate columns that match a given REGEX (i.e., `annotate -I '^(id|updated_at|created_at)'`



== Sorting

By default, columns will be sorted in database order (i.e. the order in which
migrations were run).

If you prefer to sort alphabetically so that the results of
annotation are consistent regardless of what order migrations are executed in,
use +--sort+.


== Markdown

The format produced is actually MultiMarkdown, making use of the syntax
extension for tables.  It's recommended you use +kramdown+ as your parser if
you want to use this format.  If you're using +yard+ to generate documentation,
specify a format of markdown with +kramdown+ as the provider by adding this to
your +.yardopts+ file:

    --markup markdown
    --markup-provider kramdown

Be sure to add this to your +Gemfile+ as well:

    gem 'kramdown', :groups => [:development], :require => false


== WARNING

<b>Don't add text after an automatically-created comment block.</b> This tool
will blow away the initial/final comment block in your models if it looks like
it was previously added by this gem.

Be sure to check the changes that this tool makes! If you are using Git,
you may simply check your project's status after running +annotate+:

    $ git status

If you are not using a VCS (like Git, Subversion or similar), please tread
extra carefully, and consider using one.
